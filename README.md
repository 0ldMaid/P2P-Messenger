## P2P Messenger

P2P Messenger is a peer to peer messaging app that allows for direct end to end encrypted messaging transfer. Unlike traditional messaging apps that are sometimes encrypted but still go though the company's systems, this application allows users to communicate with each other without going though a central server. Messages are delivered directly to the end user without any middle man. What's the catch? it's slow, and there is only basic functionally no pictures or videos.
