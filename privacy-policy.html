<h2 style="text-align: center;">P2P Messenger PRIVACY POLICY</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application P2P Messenger (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by 0ldMiad. P2P Messenger is a decentralized bulletin board of products or posts. The program, like Bitcoin, runs on each user's mobile phone so there is no central server. The tokens only exist because of the other users on the system. You can view anyone’s tokens but can only edit the ones you own. The system is kind of like Craigslist but built as a blockchain system. There are a total of 25,000 tokens on the system for people to use. That number cannot be changed unless the users of the system choose to update the protocol.</p> 

<p>The Application only provides the operating system for the network, we have no control over what is submitted. All user data and information is their own responsibility and does not reflect the beliefs or intentions of the developers.</p>

<h4>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h4> 

<p><strong>User Provided Information</strong></p> 
<p>The Application obtains the information you provide when you download and register the Application. And any information you enter while using it.</p>

<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p> 
<p>The Application will not collect or store any information from your device. There are no P2P Messenger servers and we do not store any data of any kind. The only information that can be collected is information you enter into the system as part of the upload process.</p>

<h4>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</h4> 
<p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device. There is no need for anyone to know your device's location and the IP is hidden though TOR. The application is designed to hide your location and IP as much as possible. But your mobile provider WILL be able to see you are using TOR even though they may not know what you are doing with it.</p> 

<h4>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h4> 
<p>Thired parties have no access to any information in the app.</p> 

<h4>What are my opt-out rights?</h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. But the information you have uploaded to the blockchain will still be viewable by other users in some cases forever.</p> 

<h4><strong>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</strong></h4> 
<p>We do not have access to your data or the ability to store it in any way.</p>  

<h4><strong>Children</strong></h4> 
<p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p> 

<h4><strong>Security</strong></h4> 
<p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information more so then almost anyone. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the app holds. For example, the application uses the latest encryption methods and TOR to prevent snooping by companies and or governments. However no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. And it is up to you to protect yourself.</p> 

<h4><strong>Changes</strong></h4> 
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. We do not have access to your email or contact details so it will be up to you to check for updates. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
